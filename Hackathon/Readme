*****
Here we analyzed the NASA LOG:
We have used 2 datasets : nasa_dataset1, nasa_dataset2
The code to read the dataset and  mapping can be found in main.py
We found some interesting results after analyzing the IP address, response time, urlâ€¦etc
We also mapped the ip address  and ran a linear regression model to predict the continent from which the request has been originated.The code can be found in Predictions.py.
The presentation file is NASA Request Log Analysis.pptx whereas Hackathon.mp4.zip is the presentation video.
